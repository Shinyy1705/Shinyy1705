# 👋 Hi, I'm Marcel/Shinyy!

I'm a 23-year-old from Germany and currently working as a **Valorant e-Sports Coach**, specializing in **1:1 coaching sessions**. When I'm not helping players reach their full potential in-game, I'm diving deep into the world of **programming** – something I've grown passionate about over the past 10 months.

## 💻 What I'm Learning

After completing the **CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python** (and earning the free certificate 🏅), I’ve been consistently improving my skills in:

- 🌐 **HTML & CSS** – Frontend basics for building websites  
- 🐍 **Python** – My first language and still my favorite for scripting & automation  
- 💠 **C#** – Especially for Windows-based applications and tools (and also to improve my OOP)

## 🔧 What I'm Building

I'm currently working on:

- 📊 **Valorant Tracker Website** – A platform to track performance and stats  
- 🤖 **VAL_RPC Bot** – A Discord Rich Presence integration for Valorant  
> 🎯 We plan to **merge** these projects into a full-featured **desktop app** in the future!

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Expand my knowledge in **full-stack development**
- Learn **APIs, databases**, and deployment best practices
- Continue building useful, gaming-related tools for the community
